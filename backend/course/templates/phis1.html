            <h2 class="title">What Is Phishing?</h2>
            <p>
                Phishing is a cybercrime where individuals are contacted via email, telephone, or text message by someone impersonating a legitimate institution. The goal is to lure victims into providing sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, banking and credit card details, and passwords. This stolen information can lead to identity theft and significant financial loss.
            </p>
            <p>
                Phishing attacks can take many forms, including emails, phone calls, and text messages. The attackers often create a sense of urgency or fear to prompt quick action from the victim, making it easier to deceive them. For example, a phishing email may claim that your bank account has been compromised and that you need to verify your identity immediately.
            </p>
            <p>
                Phishing is not just limited to emails; it can also occur through social media, instant messaging, and even phone calls. Attackers may use various tactics to gain the trust of their victims, such as creating fake profiles or using spoofed phone numbers.
            </p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="title">Historical Context</h2>
            <p>
                The first phishing lawsuit was filed in 2004 against a Californian teenager who created a fake "America Online" website to steal sensitive information from users. Since then, phishing has evolved significantly, with cybercriminals developing increasingly sophisticated techniques to deceive their targets.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the early days of the internet, phishing attacks were relatively simple and often easy to spot. However, as technology has advanced, so have the tactics used by attackers. Today, phishing is a multi-billion dollar industry, with attackers constantly refining their methods to bypass security measures and exploit human psychology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Understanding the history and evolution of phishing is crucial for recognizing and combating these threats. As phishing techniques become more sophisticated, it is essential for individuals and organizations to stay informed and vigilant.

            <h2 class="title">Common Features of Phishing Emails</h2>
            <p>
                Phishing emails often share common characteristics that can help you identify them. Here are some of the most prevalent features:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><strong>Too Good To Be True:</strong> Offers that seem overly generous (like winning a prize) are often traps. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is!</li>
                <li><strong>Sense of Urgency:</strong> Phishing emails often create a false sense of urgency, prompting quick action. Legitimate organizations typically provide ample time for responses.</li>
                <li><strong>Hyperlinks:</strong> Always hover over links to check the actual URL. Phishers often use misspelled or misleading URLs to trick users. For example, a link might look like <code>www.bankofamerica.com</code> but actually direct you to <code>www.bankofarnerica.com</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Attachments:</strong> Be cautious of unexpected attachments. They may contain malware or viruses. The only safe file type is a .txt file.</li>
                <li><strong>Unusual Sender:</strong> If an email seems out of character or unexpected, do not click on it. Always verify the sender's email address. Look for slight misspellings or unusual domains.</li>
                <li><strong>Generic Greetings:</strong> Phishing emails often use generic greetings like "Dear Customer" instead of your actual name.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2 class="title">Common Phishing Scams</h2>
            <h3 class="subTitle">Credit Card Phishing Scams</h3>
            <p>
                Phishers often send spoofed emails that mimic legitimate credit card companies. These emails may contain urgent messages prompting you to verify your account or update your information. Always be cautious and never click on links in such emails. Instead, manually type the URL of your credit card company into your browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, you might receive an email that appears to be from your credit card provider, stating that there has been suspicious activity on your account. The email may include a link to a fake website that looks identical to the real one, where you are prompted to enter your personal information.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subTitle">Bank Phishing Scams</h3>
            <p>
                Bank customers are popular targets for phishing attacks. Spoofed bank emails often request sensitive information, such as your account number or password. Legitimate banks will never ask for this information via email. Always check the sender's email address and avoid providing information through email links.
            </p>
            <p>
                A common tactic is to send an email that appears to be from your bank, claiming that your account will be suspended unless you verify your information immediately. This creates a sense of panic, leading many to fall victim to the scam.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subTitle">Email Phishing Scams</h3>
            <p>
                Email phishing involves sending fraudulent emails designed to look like they come from legitimate companies. These emails often contain links to spoofed websites that look identical to the real ones. Always verify the sender's email address and avoid clicking on links in unsolicited emails.
            </p>
            <p>
                For instance, you might receive an email from a well-known online retailer asking you to confirm your account details. If you click the link, you may be taken to a fake site that captures your login credentials.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subTitle">Website Phishing Scams</h3>
            <p>
                Phishing websites are designed to look like legitimate sites. They often use similar logos, layouts, and URLs to deceive users. If you land on a site that seems suspicious or has a lot of pop-up windows asking for personal information, double-check the URL and avoid entering any sensitive data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Always look for signs of a secure connection, such as "https://" in the URL and a padlock icon in the address bar. If these are missing, proceed with caution.

            <h2 class="title">How to Protect Yourself from Phishing</h2>
            <p>
                Protecting yourself from phishing attacks requires vigilance and awareness. Here are some effective strategies:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li><strong>Be Skeptical:</strong> Always question unsolicited emails or messages, especially those that create a sense of urgency. If something feels off, trust your instincts.</li>
                <li><strong>Verify Links:</strong> Hover over links to see the actual URL before clicking. If it looks suspicious, do not click it. Instead, navigate to the website directly through your browser.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Two-Factor Authentication:</strong> Enable two-factor authentication on your accounts for an extra layer of security. This adds an additional step to the login process, making it harder for attackers to gain access.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep Software Updated:</strong> Regularly update your operating system, browsers, and security software to protect against vulnerabilities. Many updates include security patches that can help defend against phishing attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Educate Yourself:</strong> Stay informed about the latest phishing techniques and scams to recognize them more easily. Awareness is your best defense.</li>
                <li><strong>Report Phishing Attempts:</strong> If you receive a phishing email, report it to your email provider and the organization being impersonated. This helps to combat phishing and protect others.</li>
            </ul>
